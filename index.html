          <h1>History</h1>
		  <p>ABBA, Swedish Europop group that was among the most commercially successful groups in the history of popular music. In the 1970s it dominated the European charts with its catchy pop songs. 
		  Members included songwriter and keyboard player Benny Andersson (b. December 16, 1946, Stockholm, Sweden), songwriter and guitarist Björn Ulvaeus (b. April 25, 1945, Gothenburg, Sweden),
		  and vocalists Agnetha Fältskog (b. April 5, 1950, Jönköping, Sweden) and Anni-Frid Lyngstad (b. November 15, 1945, Narvik, Norway).
          </p>
		  <p>The group began to take shape in 1969, when Andersson and Ulvaeus, who had previously collaborated on a number of folk and pop projects, met Lyngstad and Fältskog. 
		  In addition to working together musically, the four paired off romantically, with Andersson becoming involved with Lyngstad and Ulvaeus dating Fältskog. 
		  The quartet debuted as the cabaret act Festfolk, a name chosen to play on two words with nearly identical pronunciations in Swedish: festfolk, meaning “party people,” and fästfolk,
		  a 1970s slang term for “engaged couples.” Ulvaeus and Fältskog were married in 1971, and Andersson and Lyngstad followed suit in 1978. While Festfolk failed to gain a following in Sweden,
		  the song “People Need Love,” which the group recorded as Björn & Benny, Agnetha & Anni-Frid, was a modest hit in 1972. The following year the foursome finished third in the Swedish qualifying round of the Eurovision Song Contest, with the single “Ring, Ring.” 
		  Encouraged by that success and dubbed ABBA—an acronym derived from the members’ first names—by the group’s manager, Stig Anderson, the band returned to Eurovision in 1974 and captured the top prize with the song “Waterloo.” The resulting single served as the anchor for the album of the same name, released that year.
		  </p>
		  <p>More than a year after the triumph at Eurovision, ABBA (1975) truly established the group as a global pop phenomenon. The singles “Mamma Mia” and “S.O.S.” were massive hits in Europe, Australia, 
		  and North America, and the band embraced the emerging music video format to capitalize on the quartet’s shared charisma. ABBA’s 1977 release, Arrival,
		  reached the United States at the height of the disco craze, and it provided the group with its sole American number one single—the catchy and undeniably club-friendly “Dancing Queen.” 
		  The Album (1978) marked a departure of sorts: although its standout single, “Take a Chance on Me,” was a brilliant, if straightforward, pop anthem, other tracks hinted at an art rock influence,
		  and the album’s second side was dominated by a “mini-musical” titled “The Girl with the Golden Hair.”
          </p>
		  <p>While The Album marked an artistic progression for ABBA, personal relations within the band suffered when Ulvaeus and Fältskog divorced prior to the release of Voulez-Vous (1979). 
		  The pair vowed that their breakup would not affect the band’s output, but Super Trouper (1980) featured a collection of songs, most notably “The Winner Takes It All” and “Lay All Your Love on Me,” 
		  that betrayed a melancholic undercurrent that was absent in previous recordings. Andersson and Lyngstad divorced during the recording of The Visitors (1981),
		  and the reggae rhythms of “One of Us” did little to conceal the prevailing mood of the band. This second breakup proved to be too much for the group, which disbanded in 1982.
		  </p>
		  <p>After the demise of ABBA, Fältskog and Lyngstad embarked on moderately successful solo careers, and Ulvaeus and Andersson collaborated with lyricist Tim Rice to create Chess (1984), 
		  a concept album and stage musical that produced the surprise radio hit “One Night in Bangkok.” Although the band frequently quashed rumours of a possible reunion over the following years, 
		  ABBA’s music never truly left the popular consciousness. Other groups performed ABBA songs with varying degrees of faithfulness, 
		  and British dance pop band Erasure devoted an entire EP (appropriately titled ABBA-esque [1992]) to ABBA covers. 
		  The music of ABBA was also a fixture on the big screen, playing a central role in both the plots and soundtracks of such films as The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert (1994) and Muriel’s Wedding (1994).
		  </p>
		  <p>Ulvaeus and Andersson merged their shared love of musical theatre with the ABBA back catalog to produce Mamma Mia!, a romantic comedy that debuted on London’s West End in 1999 and was subsequently seen by millions of people worldwide. 
		  A film version of the play, starring Meryl Streep, was one of the top global box office draws of 2008, and a sequel, Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, appeared in 2018. 
		  The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010.
